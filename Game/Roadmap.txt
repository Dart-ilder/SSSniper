This is the road map for our project.

Minimal target functional:
  Create a computer game with the following gameplay:
    Player is given a text description of a stickman (featuring height/clothes/hairstyle)
    Player needs to find mentioned stickman on the map
    Once needed stickman is found player should click on it to "kill" him
    If player is taking too long to complete that task timer stops and he loses
  
  Features:
    Random placement of stickmans on the map
    Random clothes on the stickmans
    Singleplayer gameplay (listed above)
    Ability to only see through scope (rest of the screen is obscured by scope)

Features to be added later on (in no particular order):
  Ability to see distance to each stickman and read wind speed to concider bullet drop during shooting
  Stickman animation to make shooting them harder
  Multiplayer (through wifi) to replace timer limit with another player
  More desireable features to come...
