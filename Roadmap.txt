This is the road map for our project.

Minimal target functional:
  Create a computer game with the following gameplay:
    Player is given a text description of a stickman (featuring height/clothes/hairstyle)
    Player needs to find mentioned stickman on the map
    Once needed stickman is found player should click on it to "kill" him
    If player is taking too long to complete that task timer stops and he loses
  
  Features:
    Random placement of stickmans on the map
